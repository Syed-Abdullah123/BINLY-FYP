# Binly - Waste Management Digitalization App

**Binly** is a mobile application designed to digitalize waste management by connecting users and waste collectors (community users). The app allows users to set daily waste management goals, track their progress, and communicate with waste collectors via an in-app chat. Additionally, Binly integrates a machine learning model to classify waste items into six predefined categories, enhancing the efficiency of waste sorting and management.

Built with **React Native** and powered by **Firebase/Firestore** for real-time data storage and authentication, Binly leverages the **Context API** for state management and **Flask** as a backend to serve the ML model.

## Features

- **User Roles**:
  - **Normal Users**: Set daily waste management goals and track progress.
  - **Community Users (Waste Collectors)**: Manage waste collection tasks and interact with normal users.
  
- **Goal Tracking**: Users can set and complete daily waste management goals, which are stored in **Firestore**.

- **In-App Chat**: Real-time messaging between normal users and community users using **Firebase/Firestore**.

- **Waste Classification**: A machine learning model classifies waste items into six categories. The model is integrated into the app using **Flask** as a backend.

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication using **Firebase** and managed via the **Context API**.

- **Responsive Design**: Built with **React Native** for cross-platform compatibility (iOS and Android).
